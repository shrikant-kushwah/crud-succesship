# Product Listing Application:
Built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS) + Chakra UI (For some React Abstraction)

# Overview 
The MERN Products Application is a full-stack web app that makes it easy to manage a product inventory with simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and deployed on Render, itâ€™s designed to be both functional and user-friendly. It also implements Chakra UI on React to make components easier to import and design, basically leveraging React's component based arch.

This project is an attempt of mine to dive into the essentials of full-stack development.

# Key Features:
Create Products: Add new products to the inventory with relevant details.
Read Products: View a list of all products or search for specific products.
Update Products: Modify details of existing products.
Delete Products: Remove products from the inventory.
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and works on all devices.
Deployed on Render: The application is deployed and can be accessed live.

# Deployment: 
This app was deployed on Render (Really easily). So in case you don't want to go through all that work just to simply test it out, you can always head to: [Live Link](https://mern-products-srivatsan.onrender.com/)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
